# Quanta

A data oriented game engine/framework/library for desktop platforms written in
and for zig.

This is an unfinished, experimental project which satisfies my semi-academic
interest in game engine design. It is not yet fully useable.

- Zig 0.12.0-dev.176+c429bb5d2
- LunarG vulkan-sdk

**1. Build the example assets**
